Rules
Preparing for the game
Players sit around the board, every player needs 2 glasses
Big glass for long drinks and a smaller glass (shot glass)
Each player chooses a long drink and a type of shot for himself.

Hot to play:
Player who is the most enthusiastic about the game starts the game.
The game moves in a clockwise direction (the player on the left is next and so on). Each player throws dice once in a round except if the field he/she lands on says diffrently.

In case of a filed swap, where two players are on the same field, both throw dice. The one who gets the higher number does the swap.

If some of the fields or tasks exceedd your capabilities feel free to substitute them with your own rules.
Remember each player only gets one chance to deny performing any given task during the whole game, so choose wisely!!!


Bottoms up - Drink the whole long glass
Shot buddy - The person with whom you take a shot
Sip buddy - The person with whom you take a sip (or more!!!)
